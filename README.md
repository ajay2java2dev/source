# The Source Code
desc --> Earthnet, Skynet & Spacenet contains broad-package structure for the commits made through out the year. Skynet would contain the cloud integration, earthnet the processing support for skynet projects and spacenet the front-tier. Basically the 3 broad-package structure would mimic an generalized Model(skynet).View(spacenet).Controller(earthnet) pattern.
